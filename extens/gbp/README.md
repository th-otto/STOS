# The GBP Extension for STOS Basic by GBP

The GBP Extension introduces a number of additional commands to the STOS Basic language for the Atari ST. Here you can find the full source code for the interpreter and the compiler version of the extension, along with a number of STOS basic example files for using the commands. See MANUAL.TXT for full instructions on how the new commands work.

Enjoy!

        Before we begin I,and the rest of the STORM team would like to
thank a couple of people and  publishers  who were a great help during
the writing of this extension..


 Billy Allen..  Thanks for MISTY &  TML,   it  really  inspired  us to
get GBP finished.  Many thanks  for  the  letters,  and  I hope that I
shall hear from you quite soon.


 Steve Jarrett.. Thanks for all the  comments about the extension.


 Rick Dunlop.. Again thanks for  taking  the  extension in, and I hope
you didn't mind me sending you a  new  version every week. How are you
going with PC.. What's up?? your  routines  not fast enough to work on
an ST?????  (joke.. I think!)


 Stephen Hill.. Thanks for creating such  a wonderful book called "The
Game Makers Manual".  It  was  really  useful  while  I was originally
coding, and finally de-bugging the extension.  Hope you write a follow
up.


 Sigma Press.. Thanks for publishing Stephens book


 Abacus Software.. Thanks  for  publishing  the  "Atari  ST Internals"
book, It should pay a major  part  to  any Assembler or ST programmers
book collection.

The Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~

        Well here's the bit  you   have   all   been  waiting for, the
commands!  I must apologise at this point, as all the commands are not
in any sort of logical order, but I will try to keep them together.  I
will also try to include demo programs where applicable.


        NOTE: All addresses that are  mentioned in this extension must
be passed as actual addresses, as  the  routine will no work by simply
passing the number of the bank.   ie,  the extension will bugger up if
you use say..

                Eplay 10,length(10),0,0,1

        As the routine will  play  from  memory  address 10 instead of
bank 10. So you will have to call it like this..

                Eplay start(10),length(10),0,01


        Ok???  For more info about that consult your STOS manual.





































MISCELLANEOUS COMMANDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Command         : LIGHTS ON
Syntax          : LIGHTS ON

Description     :
                  This is a very  nice  command  that will turn on the
drive lights for disk drives A  &   B.  This command will allow you to
produce effects that have  been  seen  in demo screens where the drive
lights pulse to a piece of music,  and  also has been recently seen at
the beginning of Crack Art.



Command         : LIGHTS OFF
Syntax          : LIGHTS OFF

Description     :
                  The opposite of the last command.  You have read the
last command haven't  you??   As  mentioned  about  pulsing  the drive
lights to music, here is the routine..

        10 dreg(0)=1 : call 10 : rem * Call music Init
        20 loke $4d2,start(10)+8 : rem * Install on VBL
        30 if psg(8)>12 then lights on : else lights off
        40 wait vbl : goto 30
        50 :
        60 loke $4d2,0 : bell : rem * Turn music off

        The above routine will work with  a  MAD MAX music file loaded
into bank 10, but if you don't have  any MAD MAX music you can use the
normal STOS music (VERY CRAP!) by making these amendments

        10 rem * Routine to flash lights to CRAP MUSIC!
        20 music 1

        For more information about the PSG command turn to your manual
pages 265 & 266 (Ha! that  will  fool  all  you people who are using a
copy of STOS!!!  Buy the original you SAD people!).


















Command         : PREADY
Syntax          : X=PREADY

Description     :
                  This function tells you  if the printer connected to
the Parallel port is on-line or  not.  The variable X will contain the
status of the printer, and can only  take  2 forms..  TRUE (-1) if the
printer is on line and  ready  to  receive  data,  or FALSE (0) if the
printer is set to anything else.   Try  the following small program to
test this out..


        10 X=pready
        20 if X then bell
        30 goto 10

        This program will test the printer,  and  if it is online will
sound the STOS bell repeatedly,  otherwise  if your printer is offline
then nothing will be heard.  For more information about true and false
statements consult your STOS manual page 227.



Command         : EVEN
Syntax          : X=EVEN(NUM)

Description     :
                  The even command will return  if  the input value is
even or odd.  The output variable X  will contain true if NUM was even
or FALSE if NUM was odd..

                10 input A
                20 if even(A) then bell : else boom



























Command         : SETPRT
Syntax          : X=SETPRT(VAR)

Description     :
                  This function allows the printer configuration to be
set.  The variable VAR is a bit vector with the following meaning:

        Bitnumber       Off (0)                 On (1)

        0               Dot Matrix              Daisy Wheel
        1               Monochrome              Colour
        2               Atari Printer           Epson or Compatible
        3               Test Mode (DRAFT)       Print Mode (NLQ/LQ)
        4               Centronics Port         RS-232 Port
        5               Continuous Sheet        Single Sheet

        6-14            Reserved Bits.......................

        15              Always the value 0..................


        The following statement would set the printer to:

        . Dot Matrix Type
        . Monochrome
        . Epson or Compatible
        . Test Mode (DRAFT)
        . Centronics Port
        . Continuous Sheet

        X=setprt(%000100)

        The bit number as you will have  noticed is binary, with bit 1
being on the far right.  This binary number can be substituted for the
decimal equivalent, so the command..

        X=setprt(4)

        would be the same as the command..

        X=setprt(%000100)


        The printers parameters can be read by passing -1 as the input
variable.















Command         : SPECIAL KEY
Syntax          : X=SPECIAL KEY(I)

Description     :
                  The special key command sets  or returns the current
status of the special  keys  (ie.. Shift(s),Alt,Ctrl,Caps). The status
can be set by passing variable I as a positive integer, and by passing
I as -1 the status can be read.

                10 print "Current Status :";special key(-1)

                The value returned by special  key  is  an 8 bit value
that is read in the following way..

        Bit                     Meaning

        0                       Right Shift Key
        1                       Left Shift Key
        2                       Control (CTRL) Key
        3                       Alternate (ALT) key
        4                       Caps lock
        5                       Right Mouse Button (CLR/HOME)
        6                       Left Mouse Button (INSERT)
        7                       unused

                If the bit is set, then the button is active.



Command         : HCOPY
Syntax          : HCOPY X

Description     :
                  The annoying thing about  STOS  is  the fact that no
matter how  good  your  games,demos  etc..  are,  they  can  always be
interrupted by the system HARDCOPY  command  (ALT & HELP).  Well, that
is no longer the case.. this  command  will  turn  off and turn on the
system Hardcopy!  By passing X as 1, we turn the ALT & HELP on, and by
passing X as 0, we turn ALT & HELP off!


                10 hcopy 0 : rem Turn HARDCOPY off
                20 wait key
                30 hcopy 1 : rem Turn HARDCOPY on
















FILE COMMANDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Command         : D CRUNCH
Syntax          : D CRUNCH ADDR

Description     :
                  The D CRUNCH  command  allows  you  to  unpack files
compacted with the  most  popular  packers  around  (up  to  now).  By
passing ADDR as  the  address  of  your  compressed  data,  it will be
decompressed by the recognised file  format.  The extension can unpack
several different formats, which will be  shown in a little while, but
before we do.. a little word of warning..  The de-pack routines are a0
->  a0  routines,  which  means  that  any  compressed  data  will  be
overwritten during decompression.   It  also  means  that memory banks
will have to be reserved  to  the  original  file  length of the data,
otherwise you face overwriting some  data  that  you  may need, and in
some cases even crashing your ST.



Command         : PAKTYPE
Syntax          : X=PAKTYPE(ADDR)

Description     :
                  All recognised packer formats  have a special header
to tell them from one another..  This  command will return in variable
X, what packer the data at  address  ADDR was compressed with.  If the
packer type is  not  recognised  then  the  return  value  will  be 0.
Otherwise the value stands for..

        Value           Packer

        1               Speed Packer 2
        2               Atomik V2.5
        3               Ice V2.11
        4               Automation V5
        5               Ice V2.40
        6               Fire V2.0
        7               Speed Packer 3



Command         : PAKSIZE
Syntax          : X=PAKSIZE(ADDR)

Description     :
                  This command returns  the  uncompressed  size of the
packed file located at address ADDR.










Command         : FSTART
Syntax          : X=FSTART(N,ADDR)

Description     :
                  This command is used in  conjunction with a GBP file
bank, and returns the position in memory of file N, located in the GBP
filebank that can be found  at  address  ADDR.  A GBP bank allows many
files to be stored in  just  one  memory  bank, which programmers will
understand that means loads of data  loaded,  and still loads of banks
left.



Command         : FLENGTH
Syntax          : X=FLENGTH(N,ADDR)

Description     :
                  This command will return the length of file N, found
in the GBP bank located at address ADDR.



Command         : FOFFSET
Syntax          : X=FOFFSET(N,ADDR)

Description     :
                  This command  returns  the  offset  of  the  file N,
compared with the start of the GBP file bank. i.e file two may by 1024
bytes from the start of the bank.


        NOTE: The GBP bank builder  accessory  can be found along with
the extension files.



























GRAPHIC COMMANDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Command         : FASTWIPE
Syntax          : FASTWIPE ADDR

Description     :
                  This is a very fast version of the STOS cls command.
It will clear 32000 bytes from the  address specified by ADDR.  It can
be used to  clear  memory  banks  or  screen  addresses  (eg. physic).
However if you are clearing a memory  bank you must pass the parameter
as the start of the bank. e.g..

        10 fastwipe start(BNK)

        Where bank BNK is a reserved screen  bank, if you just want to
clear a screen address then  substitute  start(BNK) for the address of
the screen. e.g..

        10 fastwipe physic


        You may  have  seen  the  wipe  command  in  the  Missing Link
extension by Top Notch, well, no we haven't ripped/stolen the routine,
it was mine in  the  first  place,  and  I  never  got credited for it
(snarl), anyway.. This new version is  even faster (Shove that up your
jumper Top-Notch!).



Command         : ELITE UNPACK
Syntax          : ELITE UNPACK ADDR1,ADDR2

Description     :
                  This command will allow you  to unpack a Degas Elite
compressed PC? pictures.  You must set up  a  normal  STOS screen bank
to hold the resulting unpacked picture.This routine SHOULD work in all
three resolutions, but  I  haven't  tested  it  yet.   Try  this small
routine..

        10 key off : curs off : mode 0 : hide
        20 reserve as screen 10
        30 reserve as work 11,(length of PC? file)
        40 bload "FILENAME.PC?",11
        50 elite unpack start(11),start(10)
        60 screen copy 10 to physic
        70 get palette(10)











        This will unpack the picture from bank 11 to bank 10, and then
display it on the screen.   Once  the  picture  has been unpacked, the
palette can then be grabbed in  the  normal  way.  Screens can also be
unpacked directly to the screen, ie..

         elite unpack start(10),physic


                The palette for the picture  can  then be installed by
using the command..

        get palette(physic)



Command         : TINY UNPACK
Syntax          : TINY UNPACK ADDR,ADDR2

Description     :
                  This command does  exactly  the  same  as  the ELITE
UNPACK command, except that it will unpack a TINY compressed image.



Command         : CA UNPACK
Syntax          : CA UNPACK ADDR,ADDR2

Description     :
                  Again this command is  the  same  as  ELITE UNPACK &
TINY UNPACK, although this routine will  packed an image file saved in
the Crack Art format (CA?).



Command         : CA PACK
Syntax          : X=CA PACK ADDR,ADDR2,PAL,MODE

Description     :
                  This command is to be  used  in conjunction with the
CA UNPACK command, and  will  actually  create  a compressed Crack Art
image file from a  standard  STOS  screen  bank.   ADDR  is the source
image, ADDR2 is the destination for  the  compressed image, PAL is the
address of  the  palette  data  to  be  used,  which  will  usually be
ADDR+32000,  and  MODE  is  the  pictures  screen  resolution  (0=Low,
1=Medium, 2=High).  The value returned is the length of the compressed
picture file.  This routine should help you sort this out..

        10 reserve as screen 10
        20 L=ca pack physic,start(10),physic+32000,0
        30 bsave "picture.ca1",start(10) to start(10)+L

                This routine will compress the current physical screen
into bank  10,  and  then  save  it.   The  variable  L  contains  the
compressed length of the image file.
Command         : SETPAL
Syntax          : SETPAL ADDR

Description     :
                  The SETPAL command will  install  a new palette that
is located at address ADDR.   It  is  useful for storing large palette
changes in a memory bank, and  then  setting  them when every they are
needed.  The format for the data is just the standard degas format, in
that it is 16 words, each word representing the colour 0 - 15.


        10 reserve as work 10,32 : mem=start(10)
        20 restore 80 : for lp=0 to 15 : read(x)
        30 doke mem,x : mem=mem+2
        40 next lp
        50 :
        60 setpal start(10) : wait vbl : end
        70 :
        80 data $000,$111,$222,$333,$444,$555,$666,$777
        90 data $000,$111,$222,$333,$444,$555,$666,$777

                This routine will copy  some  values  into memory bank
10, and the set the palette from it.



Command         : BCLS
Syntax          : BCLS ADDR,SCAN

Description     :
                  The  BCLS  command,  will  erase  a  set  amount  of
scanlines on any desired bit plane of  the screen.  The address of the
screen is passed in ADDR,  and  the  number  of  scanlines to erase is
passed in the variable ADDR..

        10 bcls physic,10

                This will  clear  10  scanlines  on  plane  1  of  the
physical screen.  The other planes  of  the  screen can be selected by
increasing the screen address by 2

                +0      = Plane 1
                +2      = Plane 2
                +4      = Plane 3
                +6      = Plane 4





















Command         : MIRROR
Syntax          : MIRROR OPT,ADDR,SYPOS,ADDR2,DYPOS,NUM

Description     :
                  The mirror command is quite powerful, in that it can
mirror parts of the screen, in three ways.. Normal, Halved or Doubled.
The mirror option is passed  in  the  OPT  variable,  and can take the
form..

                1       Normal
                2       Half Copy
                3       Double Copy

        Variable ADDR is the source address of the image, and SYPOS is
the source Y pixel offset.   ADDR2  is the destination screen address,
and DYPOS is the destination  Y  pixel  offset.   NUM is the number of
lines to mirror. ie..

        10 mirror 1,physic,0,physic,100,32

                This will mirror the STOS key box to the middle of the
screen.. Try putting it into  a  loop,  and  see what happens when you
move the mouse over it!



STE COMMANDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~



Command         : DAC VOLUME
Syntax          : DAC VOLUME VOL

Description     :
                  This command will set  the  main  volume  of the STE
sound output to VOL.  The input  value  can  take  the form 0 - 40 (40
being the loudest).

        10 rem ** STE fade out
        20 for LP=40 to 0 step -1
        30 for LP2=0 to 15 : wait vbl : next LP2
        40 dac volume LP : next LP

















Command         : TREBLE
Syntax          : TREBLE TREB

Description     :
                  This command  sets  the  amount  of  treble  that is
output from the STE sound. TREB can take the form 0 - 12 (0 = -12dB, 6
= 0dB, 12 = +12dB).



Command         : BASS
Syntax          : BASS BAS

Description     :
                  Same as above, but sets the amount of bass instead.



Command         : EPLAY
Syntax          : EPLAY STRT,LENGTH,SPEED,MODE,PLAYMODE

Description     :
                  EPLAY  allows  hardware   sample   playing   on  STE
machines, or machines that have  the  extended sound capability.  STRT
is the start address of the  sample,  and  LENGTH is the length of the
sample.  SPEED variable sets the replay speed of the sample, which can
be..

                0 =  6.258 kHz
                1 = 12.517 kHz
                2 = 25.033 kHz
                3 = 50.066 kHz

                        The MODE variable sets mono/stereo playback of
the sample.. 0 = stereo, 1 = mono.  And finally, PLAYMODE can be.. 0 =
stop, 1 = play once, 3 = loop forever.

                Although the sample replay  can  be  stopped using the
EPLAY command, I have also added  an  ESTOP  command, that can also be
used to stop the sample.....



Command         : ESTOP
Syntax          : ESTOP

Description     :
                  This will stop the hardware sample replay interrupt,
and stop ANY sample that is playing under STE hardware.











Command         : EPLACE
Syntax          : X=EPLACE

Description     :
                  This command does the same  as the SAM PLACE command
that already exists in STOS, however, it returns the address in memory
that is currently being played by  the  STE  hardware.  It can be used
for doing all sorts  of  nice  effects  including  frequency meters or
oscilloscopes....

        10 rem ** Oscilloscope routine
        20 key off : curs off : hide : mode 1

That's All Folks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        Yes, that's all the commands  in  this great extension.. So go
away and have some fun using them.


Bonus
~~~~~

        You may have noticed that there is an extra basic extension on
the disk. Well it's the follow  up  extension..  GBP II, and this time
it's going to be deadly. The  extension  is very much like the blitter
extension, being in a very early  stage.  There is no documentation as
of yet (it is currently being written).  I  will however go over a few
of the command within this text file  so  that you can get the feel of
the extension and get to use it a little bit.

        The extension itself is primarly  for  use on STE machines, as
most of the command are  based  around the specific hardware. Although
some commands will actually work on  older  ST machines, but it is not
really worth running.  The commands  themself  range from accessing an
Atari powerpad/Jaguar controller  (both  ports!).  Centronics/Parallel
joystick routines, screen savers, and hardware scolling.












GBP II Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        There are not many as of yet,  but the ones that are there are
very useful so STE owners.. Only the basic extension is available, and
the compiler version will be out  soon,  costing a registration fee of
five pounds sterling. Updated demo  versions  will  be sent out to all
registered GBP extension users.


ATARI POWER PAD/JAGUAR CONTROLLER COMMANDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        The following  10  commands  allow  the  Atari powerpad/Jaguar
controller to  be  accessed  from  within  STOS  basic.  So  plug  you
controller into port A or B and you can use EVERY button!

        In all the commands  the  passed  variable  (port) is the port
number of the controller you  want  to  access  (0 = portA, 1 =portB).
Every command returns TRUE or FALSE once tested (ie TRUE if the button
is being pressed). The naming of  the  commands is simple enough, so I
won't bother with any explanations..

        I have had  a  spot  of  bother  using  the  commands within a
continuous loop (ie.. repeat : x=padup(0) : until false). This problem
is solved by simply calling the  routines  within VBL timed loop (ie..
repeat : x=padup(0) :  wait  vbl  :  until  false)..    This  is a bug
inherent with the STE  reading  the  controllers,  and causes the same
trouble when writing assembler  programs  (just  incase  you wanted to
know!).

        x = padup(port)        ** Up,down,left,right commands **
        x = paddown(port)
        x = padleft(port)
        x = padright(port)

        x = padpause           ** Pause button  **
        x = padoption          ** Option button **

        x = padafire           ** Fire A button **
        x = padbfire           ** Fire B button **
        x = padcfire           ** Fire C button **


        The next command if  for  getting  the  status of the numbered
buttons (the grey key pad), and  it  returns  a 16 bit value (1 word),
that has the following meaning..

  bit  15  14  13  12  11  10  09  08  07  06  05  04  03  02  01 00
  ------------------------------------------------------------------
       na  na  na  na   *   #   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1  0









CENTRONICS JOYSTICKS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        Very similar to the powerpad commands, again the variable port
is the port number (0 or 1)

        csticks on                ** Turn centronics routine on  **
        csticks off               ** Turn centronics routine off **

        x=cstickup(port)          ** Up,down,left,right commands **
        x=cstickdown(port)
        x=cstickleft(port)
        x=cstickright(port)


STE HARDWARE SCROLLING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        hardscreen addr           ** Set hardscreen address to addr **
        hardlinewid wid           ** Set hardline width to wid **
        hardpixel ofs             ** Set the pixel scroll offset to
                                     ofs (0-15)

        These hardware scrolling routines  are  only  very simple, but
they actually work better than any  others  that  I have seen, this is
because the user has complete control over the address increments etc,
thus making programming  hardware  scrolling  more  flexible (a little
more difficult maybe, but more flexible).  These routines are also the
fastest STOS hardware scroll routine to date!


SCREEN SAVER ROUTINE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        Yes, you guessed it, this  extension  has a screen saver built
into it.  These commands will NEVER  be  in  a compiled program, it is
just a little utility that will  save TSR programs being loaded before
STOS itself, and this screen saver works in all resolutions too!


Command:        setclock n
Description:    Sets screen saver delay to  n  seconds, ie setclock 10
will activate the screen  saver  10  seconds  after any input/movement
stops.


Command:        screensaveron scr
Description:    Starts the screen  saver  routine  going. The variable
scr is the screen that  the  screen  saver  will  be  active on. It is
always best to select physic for  normal programs, however if you have
written a program that uses the screen  swap command, you can also set
it to logic.








Command:        screensaveroff
Description:    De-activates the screen saver.


******** NOTES ********

        This screen saver routine is  completely interupt driven. What
does this mean??  Well  when  activated  your  STOS  environment keeps
executing in  the  background,  wether  you  are  simply  programming,
compiling, or even running STOS program, they will continue to execute
EVEN when  the  screen  saver  is  active!!!  TRY  IT  OUT  WITH  THIS
ROUTINE...


        10 setclock 20 : rem * Set saver to activate in 20 seconds
        20 screensaver on physic : rem * Activate saver
        30 x=0 : repeat
        40 inc x : wait vbl
        50 until x=2000 : bell


        you will the STOS bell while the screen saver is active.. THUS
proving that execution continues!!!

        The screen saver  routine  itself  checks  keyboard,joystick &
mouse input, so make sure you don't touch any of them!!

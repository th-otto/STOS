Welcome to Part 1 of my STE EXTENSION guide. In this part we are going to 
look at the commands offered by the extension.

Let's start with the commands that I'm most familiar with, the DMA sound 
commands. All the sound commands begin with DAC, which stands for Digital 
to Analogue Converter.

Using these commands you can play samples recorded using MASTERSOUND II, 
STEREO MASTER and any other sampler that saves samples in signed format, 
that is provided they were recorded at 6.25kHz, 12.5kHz, 25kHz or 50kHz.

DAC SPEED n

        10 DAC SPEED 1

        This sets the playback speed where n is a value from 0 to 3

        0 -  6.25kHz
        1 -  12.5kHz
        2 -  25.0kHz
        3 -  50.0kHz

DAC MONO

        10 DAC MONO

        This sets up the DMA hardware ready to play a MONO sample.

DAC STEREO

        10 DAC STEREO

        This sets up the DMA hardware ready to play a STEREO sample.

DAC CONVERT start address,end address

        10 DAC CONVERT start(15),start(15)+length(15)

        Using this command you can convert an unsigned sample to signed 
        format. Start and end are the start and end addresses of the sample
        that you wish to convert.

DAC LOOP ON
DAC LOOP OFF

        10 DAC LOOP ON

        When a sample is played it will play continuously.

        10 DAC LOOP OFF

        When the sample is played it will only play through once and then 
        stop.

DAC RAW sample start address,sample end address

        10 DAC RAW start(15),start(15)+length(15)

        This command plays the sample between the two addresses start and 
        end.

DAC M VOLUME n

        10 DAC M VOLUME 40

        This command sets the overall volume of the sound output.
        n is the volume and can be between 0 and 40.

DAC L VOLUME n
DAC R VOLUME n
        
        10 DAC L VOLUME 15
        20 DAC R VOLUME 18

        These two commands allow independent volume control for the left 
        and right sound outputs. n is the volume and is a value between 0 
        and 20.

DAC STOP
    
        10 DAC STOP

        This commands stops any sample that is being played.

DAC MIX ON
DAC MIX OFF

        10 DAC MIX ON

        DAC MIX ON allows samples and sounds from the ST's PSG sound chip
        all to be played through the DAC together.



If you want some examples/samples send me a disk(preferably with something
on it) and I'll send you some samples and demo progs.

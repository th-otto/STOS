
                     STOS AND THE STE PART 2
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


E PALETTE $RGB,$RGB,$RGB,$RGB.......(16 colour values)

        10 E PALETTE $F00,$E00,$D00,$C00,$707,$101,$211,$000,$46A,$5A5,
           $414,$333,$555,$FFF,$BBB,$999

This is the same as the PALETTE command in STOS, and can be used to
define the colour palette.

RGB are red, green and blue values in hexadecimal. The values you 
can use are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F

E COLOUR n,$RGB

10 E COLOUR 5,$7A0

This command is used to set one colour, again the RGB values are 
hexadecimal. This is the same as the COLOUR command in STOS.

x=E COLOR(c)

        10 x=E COLOR(5)
        20 PRINT HEX$(x,3)

The command x=E COLOR(c) returns the RGB value of colour c into the 
variable x.

x=STE

        10 x=STE
        20 IF x=1 THEN PRINT "This is an ATARI STE"
        30 IF x=0 THEN PRINT "This is not and ATARI STE"

Using this command you can detect if your program is running on an 
STE or not.

x=LIGHT X
y=LIGHT Y

        10 REPEAT
        20 x=LIGHT X
        30 y=LIGHT Y
        40 PLOT x,y
        50 UNTIL FALSE

If you have a light pen or light gun attached to the analogue joystick 
port of your STE then the x and y co-ordinates on screen can be returned 
with these commands. LIGHT X and LIGHT Y contain the x and y co-ordinates 
when the fire button or light pen button is pressed. See x=FSTICK(j)

x=LSTICK(j) : REM Left
x=RSTICK(j) : REM Right
x=DSTICK(j) : REM Down
x=USTICK(j) : REM Up
x=FSTICK(j) : REM Fire

These commands are used for detecting the joysticks, j which can be from 
1 to 6.

x=FSTICK(3) can be used to detect the light pen/gun's fire button.

STICKS ON
STICKS OFF

This switches on interrupts for joystick ports one and two.  STICKS ON 
also disables the mouse, and so if you need to use the mouse again then 
you need to use STICKS OFF

x=STICK1 : REM Joystick in mouse port
x=STICK2 : REM Joystick port

These two commands can be used to return the status of joysticks one and 
two.

        Value of x returned :-

          1 - Up
          2 - Down
          4 - Left
          8 - Right
        128 - Fire

For diagonals x will be the sum of the values, for example :-  If up and 
left are pressed together x will be 5 If fire and right are pressed then 
x will be 136

There are some hardware scrolling commands, but try as I may I can't 
get them to work. If YOU know how they work please tell me!

Have fun with these commands, and maybe we'll see some more STOS STE 
games!.

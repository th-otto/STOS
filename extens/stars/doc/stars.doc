This is a wonderous new extension for anyone who has STOS Basic.  Now you can
create those magnificent parallax star fields with just a single command and
then have total control over where it moves with another.  What's more, this
extension is over 20 (yes TWENTY) times faster than the fastest and least
versatile STOS code.  You're not just limited to parallax stars fields either.
How about a star field that looks like you're flying through it?  Now you can
create that stunning Xenon II effect in STOS and with STOS 3D, there's nothing
to stop you playing around with Star Trek like effects.


GETTING STARTED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To your life as easy as possible all you have to do is run the INST_EXT.BAS
file from within STOS.  Using this will install both the interpreter and the
compiler extensions.  This program is clear and needs no explanation here.
However as more and more STOS extensions become available, so the problems of
naming extensions increases.  STOS only allows 26 extensions, one for each
letter of the alphabet and if you've already got an extension with the same
name as the new one then life gets difficult.  This program allows you to
specify which letter of the alphabet you wish to use.  This also creates a
problem with example programs.  There is little point me writting a program
under the STARS.EXH name if you install the extension as STARS.EXO.  This
program contains a few examples which are automatically modified to make them
run regardless of how you name the extension.  Clever isn't it!

That's all there is to it!  Now re-boot STOS and you'll have four new
commands at your fingertips.


NEW COMMANDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The full list of new commands is as follows...

       SET STARS 100,t,sx,sy,ex,ey,sc,ec
                               This sets up 100 stars of type t
                               (make t=0 for flat stars OR
                                     t=1 for parallax stars OR
                                     t=2 for 'zooming' stars) that move
                               between the co-ords' sx,sy,ex & ey with colours
                               between sc and ec.  If the type is set for
                               parallax stars, then stars with lowest colour
                               (i.e SC) will move slowest while highest colour
                               stars (i.e EC) will move fastest.

       GO STARS x,y,screen     This moves stars defined with SET STARS by
                               multiples of x and y along the x and y axis.
                               Negative numbers move left and up, positive
                               move right and down.  Stars will be drawn on
                               'screen'  This should be loaded with logical
                               screen address.  Stars are NOT drawn on the
                               sprites BACK screen.

      WIPE STARS ON            This extension is incredably fast!  However,
                               normally you're left to erase the screen before
                               using the GO STARS instruction by the CLS
                               command.  While this is use-able, it's slow.
                               Putting this command at the beginning of your
                               program will automatically erase the screen and
                               then draw the stars.  The CLS command is no
                               longer needed before the GO STARS command.  Any
                               program using this will run considerably
                               faster.  Please note that the ENTIRE screen is
                               erased.

      WIPE STARS OFF           Turns off the automatic clearing process.


SUGGESTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~
Try implementing a parallax star field in Zoltar.  The following lines
should make this easier...

       55 set stars 50,1,0,0,319,192,1,3 : wipe stars on

       replace line 10200 with...

       10200 go stars 0,1,logic : screen copy 10,0,192,320,200 to
             logic,0,192 : return

You'll now find that Zoltar now runs considerably faster and looks a great
deal better.  Try it!

THE COMPILER
~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you have the compiler then you'll need to install the compiler
extension into the compiler file on your WORKING compiler disk.  Simply
run the installation program as before and you can now compile all the
star commands.

THE CRUNCH!
~~~~~~~~~~~
This extension is public domain.  Please do not abuse this system!  Feel free
to give copies of ALL these files to who-ever wants them.  DO NOT charge
for it.

I'd welcome any help or suggestions for improvement and if you have any then

I must thank Asa Burrows for helping me with this, especially with the compiler
extension.  If you need any help with anything STOS related, contact him
through the ST Format ST Answers section.

Many Thanks Asa.

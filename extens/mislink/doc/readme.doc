        First of all, format four disks (unless you've got a hard-
drive of course).

        Copy about four of the .TOS files onto each of the disks.  Now
run each one in turn.  They will automatically depack and save out all
of the example programs and data onto the disk.  When a TOS file has
loaded and before ot starts to unpack, it will ask you if you want to
delete it.  Press'Y' when it asks

        Once you've done all of the programs you ought to have four
disks crammed full of programs, examples, music files, fonts and great
stuff generally.  Enjoy!

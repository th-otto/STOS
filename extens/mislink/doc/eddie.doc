		     The Missing Link Map Editor. v1.0.

About
-----
	This utility was written to make designing maps for use with
the Missing Link WORLD and LANDSCAPE commands as easy as possible.  It
provides the user with extremely powerful features while still remaining
easy to use.

Instructions
------------
	When you first run the program you will be in the map screen,
so press SPACE to get to the main menu.

	The main menu consists of a series of icons along the top of
the screen with the rest of the screen being taken up by the blocks
you loaded in.
	The icons are, from left to right:
	
	LOAD BLOCKS
		Select this if you want to load a different set of
		blocks.

	LOAD A MAP
		Click on this to load in some WORLD or LANDSCAPE data
		you have already saved.
		
	SAVE A WORLD
		This will save out the map in the format needed by
		the WORLD command.
		
	SAVE A LANDSCAPE
		This saves out the map in LANDSCAPE format.
	
	RESIZE MAP
		You can use this to change the dimensions of the map.
		After selection you are asked for the new X and Y sizes
		of the map, so enter the sizes you want and the map
		will be set to these dimensions.
	

	Please note that you cannot load LANDSCAPE data into Eddie!
Any attempts to do so will make things go badly wrong.  If you are
using LANDSCAPE in your game then you will have to make up a special
set of WORLD blocks to do the map-editing.  This will all be fixed in
the registration version (honestly...)
	To set the blocks which you will actually draw with, use the
left and right mousebuttons to click on the desired block.  Whichever
block you click on will be allocated to the mousebutton you used to 
select it when you draw on the actual map.
	You also set up the "brick" data here.  By moving the mouse
over a block then pressing a number from 1 to 9 that block will be
allocated to that number for the brick and column fills in the map screen.

	To go to the map screen press the SPACE bar.  You can exit
the program by pressing UNDO.  You can also get online help by pressing
the "*" key on the numeric keyppad.

	The map screen is taken up by the current map with the current
X and Y position on the bottom-left of the screen.  You can move the
mouse around to move about the map and pressing the left or right
mousebutton will place the block allocated to that button.
	Pressing SPACE will take you back to the main menu.

	The extra features of the map-editor are all accessed via the
keyboard.  Here is a list of the keys and their function:

F1/F2	:	Use these keys to set the top-left and bottom-right
		of an "area".  "Areas" are the term used in the program
		for a rectanguler area used for the cut and paste, fill
		and other features.  Once set the blocks in the "area"
		will be shown with a coloured pattern overlayed on them.

F3	:	This will clear the area-markers set up with F1/F2.

F4	:	Use this to paste a copy of an area somewhere on the
		map.  The copy will be placed at the current mouse
		position.

F5	:	This will fill the map from the top-left of the area
		to the current mouseposition with copies of the area.

F9	:	Use this to save an area to disk.

F10	:	This will load in a previously saved area.

Insert/	:	These keys will fill the area with the block allocated
Clr Home	to the left/right mousebuttons.

Backspace :	This will fill an area with block 0.

Delete	:	This is the same as Backspace, but the area markers will
		be cleared as if you had pressed Backspace then F3.

Help	:	Pressing Help will highlight the current area again.
		This can be very useful if you have drawn over the top
		of your area and wish to see where it is again.

1-9	:	Pressing 1-9 will fill the current area with columns of
(keuboard)	the blocks you allocated brick-numbers in the main menu.
		The number you press will define the width of the
		columns.  For instance, pressing 5 will mean you get
		columns of block 1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5,1,2... etc.

1-9	:	These will fill the area with a brick-wall of the
(keypad)	blocks you allocated in the main menu.  This is an
		extremely useful function for doing walls which are made
		up of multiple-block bricks.


Last word

	Bye!
